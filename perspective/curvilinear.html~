<h2>Curvilinear Perspective</h2>
<!-- Human Field of Vision H180 V135 -->
<span class=fl>W</span>e 
have now seen that given the impracticality of forcing the viewing distance,
a painting designed according to the laws of linear perspective
does not in general afford the viewer a perfect illusion of space.

<p>
Are we to conclude then that a  painting is doomed to fail?  
Not so fast: There is no carved-in-stone law which says a painting must provide
a perfect illusion, 
even though when it is achieved the effect is admittedly "pretty neat".
Fact is, even the most casual picture viewer implicitly understands that a painting is 
<i>a depiction of a visual experience</i>, as opposed to a perfect impostor of reality.
(On a more fundamental level,
the very convention of a painting being enclosed by a rectangular frame 
inevitably frustrates any such attempt at imposition, 
for the simple reason that our field of vision has no frame around it.)

<p>
So, perhaps we could settle for a different goal altogether:
Namely, instead of trying to achieve an absolutely convincing illusion of space, 
we could aim for a depiction of the visual experience of a space.

<p>
We then have to ask: How exactly is a visual experience produced?
To answer this question we need to consider the anatomical issue how we see.
The basic optical mechanism of the human eye is not unlike that of a camera.
The chief difference is that an inverted image of the physical scene
is now projected onto the <i>spherical</i> (or more accurately quasi-spherical) 
surface of the retina.
This projection is a type of <b>curvilinear perspective</b>.
In the eyeball situation,
the projected retinal image is subject to <b>barrel distortion</b>,
where every physical line projects to a line which terminates at a vanishing point 
(whereas in the case of linear perspective, a transversal line has no vanishing point.)
Barrel distortion is one type of curvilinear perspective, 
the other type being <b>pin-cushion distortion</b>.

<p>
In more concrete terms, barrel distortion is demonstrated in Leonardo da Vinci's 
observation that a long rectangular shape facing the viewer appears to
diminish in height towards either end of the field of vision.
Likewise, it is barrel distortion at work
when a tall building appears narrower and narrower (however slightly) 
towards the top of our field of vision.

<p>
Hence, our visual experience of the world really obeys the laws of
curvilinear perpsective, 
even though we may not think that is the case, 
since the deviation from linear perspective is often slight, 
and only clearly noticeable in our peripheral vision.
