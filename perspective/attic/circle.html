<h2>The Column Problem</h2>
<span class=fl>S</span>o far, in our discussion of linear perspective, 
the basic setup was that the perspectival image is the intersection
of the picture plane and the cone of light rays reflecting off the physical scene.
As such, the perspectival image is an absolutely faithful imitation 
of the physical scene.
Namely, an appropriately situated viewer of the picture sees an image that is 
optically <i>identical</i>
with what they would see had they been physically in front of the actual scene
at a correspondingly prescribed distance.

We now examine what might happen when the viewer's eye is not fixed in space,
in the context of what's commonly known as "The Column Problem."

<p>
Suppose we wish to depict a row of evenly spaced Greek columns parallel to the picture plane (i.e. front facing).
Two rules of linear perspective relevant to this construction are as follows:
<p>
@collapse ellipse1@
<b>1.</b> Physical ellipses poject to pictorial ellipses.
<br>
@collapse ellipse2@
<b>2.</b> Linear perspectival projection preserves tangency.  In other words,
if a physical line is tangent to a physical object, 
then their pictorial projections are also tangent.
<hr>
@collapse ellipse3@
Due to these two rules, 
the bases of columns project to ellipses which 
becomes more and more elongated and slanted towards the left and right ends 
of the picture.

Moreover, the projected images of the columns would appear
wider and wider, and spaced closer and closer, 
towards either end of the picture plane.

All of that is perfectly fine with regard to the rules of linear perspective, 
and would in fact create the correct optical illusion, provided that
the spectator views the painting
<i><b>from a uniquely prescribed height and distance with one immobile eye</b></i>.  
@sep
<p>
In reality, that is almost never the 
case, and to a casual viewer strolling by, the columns would just appear distorted.
<!-- 
(Another factor is that many paintings do not aim to produce an illusory space
which is in one-to-one scale to the scene being illustrated.  
The distortions might appear especially pronounced if the painting is 
a scaled-down version of the original scene, which is very often the case.)
-->
This phenomenon has been a subject of serious consideration since the Renaissance, 
by such eminent figures as Piero della Francesca and Leonardo da Vinci.

<p>
Leonardo studied this problem of distortion to the roving viewer
and concluded that it cannot be avoided, unless the picture plane is situated 
"<b>at least 20 times as far off as the greatest width or height of the objects 
represented.</b>"  
<!-- https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Notebooks_of_Leonardo_Da_Vinci/IX -->
In otherwords, if you want to incorporate into your painting
a row of columns, 
and you have not either the means or intention of fixing your viewer's eye at one point 
in space, <i>and</i> you want to achieve a convincing visual illusion,
then you should consider placing any front-facing row of columns 
far into the background.

In practice, painters who utilize linear perspective sometimes
"break the rules" when it comes to circles and columns.
Dora Norton opined in <i>Freehand Perspective and Sketching</i>
that:
<blockquote><i>
... cylindrical objects, however placed, 
should be drawn as if for those objects alone...
But this does not apply to the 
straight-line portions of the 
picture..., nor to the placing of the cylindrical parts, nor 
to their height. These must be determined in the ordinary way
</i>[(i.e. using standard rules of linear perpsective)].

Hence, in a painting which otherwise adheres to the rule of linear perspective 
with absolute precision, the base of a cylindrical column off to the side 
may be depicted as a level ellipse, instead of a slanted one.
