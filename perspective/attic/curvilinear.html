<h2>Curvilinear Perspective</h2>
<p>
The basic optical mechanism of the human eye is not unlike that of a camera.
The chief difference is that an inverted image of the physical scene
is now projected onto the <i>spherical</i> (or more accurately quasi-spherical) 
surface of the retina.
This projection is a type of <b>curvilinear perspective</b>.
In the eyeball situation,
the projected retinal image is subject to <b>barrel distortion</b>,
where every physical line projects to a line which terminates at a vanishing point 
(whereas in the case of linear perspective, a transversal line has no vanishing point.)
Barrel distortion is one type of curvilinear perspective, 
the other type being <b>pin-cushion distortion</b>.

<p>
In more concrete terms, barrel distortion is demonstrated in Leonardo da Vinci's 
observation that a long rectangular shape facing the viewer appears to
diminish in height towards either end of the field of vision.
Likewise, it is barrel distortion at work
when a tall building appears narrower and narrower (however slightly) 
towards the top of our field of vision.

<p>
Hence, our visual experience of the world really obeys the laws of
curvilinear perpsective, 
even though we may not think that is the case, 
since the deviation from linear perspective is often slight, 
and only clearly noticeable in our peripheral vision.
