<h2>The Mathematics of Linear Perspective</h2>
<span class=fl>T</span>he idea behind linear perspective is simple:  
First, we assume that we are observing a physical scene
(a basket of fruit, a sunset in over the ocean...) with one eye only.
Now put up an imaginary vertical screen (called the <b>picture plane</b>)
between the eye and the scene.
For each object in the physical scene (an apple, a flower, a grain of sand...),
there is a collection of light rays which are reflected off the object and then enter 
our eye.  (That is how we normally see.)  Suppose that on the way to our eyeball,
each of these light rays makes a mark (with the same color as the light) 
on the picture plane.  
The resulting colored picture plane has the property that: wherever we place it, 
and as long as we stand at the same distance from it as before,
the picture plane presents to our eye an image which is indistinguishable 
from the original physical scene (our basket of fruits, the sunset).  
It apears as if the space we saw now lies <i>inside</i> the flat picture plane.

Now, let's flip the idea around.  If we can figure out the laws which govern
the placement of the marks by the light rays reflecting off the physical scene,
then we could start with a blank canvas, place marks on it according to the same laws,
and <i>produce</i> an illusion of a three-dimensional physical scene contained within 
the canvas 
(whether or not the scene thus illustrated actually exists in the real world).
@sep
<p>
What are these laws?  We name a few here.
In the following:

<ul>
<li>We prefix any element in the physical scene with the word <b>physical</b>, and
any element on the picture plane with the word <b>pictorial</b>.

<li>We call a physical line which is perpendicular to the picture plane an 
<b>orthogonal line</b>.

<li>We call a physical line which is parallel to picture plane a 
<b>transversal line</b>.

<li>We also assume the picture plane is infinitely large.

</ul>

<h3>Laws of Linear Perspective</h3>
@collapse law1@
<b>1.</b> With one type of exceptions (Exercise, which one?),
straight physical lines project to straight pictorial lines.
<br>
@collapse law2@
<b>2.</b> Transversal lines project to the picture plane with no distortion, 
e.g. a horizontal (resp. vertical) 
transversal line projects to a horizontal (resp. vertical) pictorial line.
<p>
In particular, parallel transversal lines project to parallel pictorial lines.
<br>
@collapse law3@
<b>3.</b> Every non-transversal line projects to a pictorial line
which terminates at a <b>vanishing point</b> on the picture plane.
Moreover:
<ul>
<li>
Any set of parallel non-transversals share the same vanishing point.
<li>
The vanishing points of <i>horizonal</i> 
non-transversals lie on the <b>horizon</b> of the picture plane.
This is the horizontal line on the picture plane which is level with the viewer's eye.
<li>
The vanishing point every orthogonal line lies at the center of the horizon.
<ul>
<!-- <li>
Parallel physical lines which are tilted up (resp. down) 
outwards project to pictorial lines
whose vanishing point lies above (resp. below) the horizon.  
Two sets of parallel physical lines with the same vertical pitch poject to 
picture lines with vanish points 
which lie on the same vertical level on the picture plane.

</div></div></div>

Of course, in practice, no one paints on an infinitely large canvas,
so the "infinite" picture plane is necessarily cropped, 
and consequently vanishing points may lie outside of the painting.

<p>
It is remarkable that with  only these simple rules, and
a little bit of ingenuity in their application, 
some great visual results could be obtained.

<span class=fl>B</span>esides 
employing the geometric rules outlined above to depict objects viewed in perspective,
there are various mechanical or semi-mechanical means to produce the same effect. 

In the following illustration by Albrecht D&uumlrer,
the "imaginary screen" we used in devising linear perspective 
is realized physically as a gridded net (grid #1) 
placed between a draftsman and the physical scene (in this case a reclining nude).
Before the draftsman lies a drawing surface with a similar grid system (grid #2) 
overlaid upon it.  
Viewing the physical scene with one eye placed at a fixed point, 
various points of the scene lies directly behind points on grid #1.
If, say, the tip of the nose of the woman lies behind the grid point
on grid #1 which is two from the top and one from the left, then the draftsman
would draw the tip of the nose on the drawing surface at the corresponding point 
on grid #2.
Repeating this process for each point in the physical scene, 
a perspectival drawing of the scene is obtained.

In fact, having a screen between the viewer and the physical scene which records
all the instances of light rays reflecting off the scene is quite similar
to the mechanism of the photographic camera, 
<!-- where the "screen" is a segment of photographic film -->
<!-- (or an array of digital photosensors) which lies on the other side of the focal point. -->
whose development traces back to a device called the <i>camera obscura</i>, which means
"dark room" in Latin 
(and is indeed the etymological origin of the modern word "camera"). 
It works as follows: A pinhole is made on one side of a sealed
box or room, and a screen is set up in the room facing the pinhole.  
Light rays which enter from outside the room then cast an inverted image 
of the physical scene outside.  
A draftsman could then trace the outlines of the outside scene directly onto the screen.

Aside from the inversion 
(and various degrees of distortion depending on implementation, 
such as the use of a lens),
the projected image produced by a camera obscura 
largely follows the same geometric laws of projection 
which underlie linear perspective.
Consequently, 
it can be difficult to deduce whether a painter has employed
linear perspective, a camera obscura, or some other optical means 
(a grid like the one illustrated by D&uumlrer, a <i>camera lucida</i>, etc.).
The following painting by Vermeer is the subject of the motion picture 
<i>Tim's Vermeer</i>, which documents one man's quest to determine
if Vermeer had employed optical tools to produce the painting.

</div>

One must be aware though, 
that any such analysis is invariably complicated by the fact that a painter 
is a human agent free to deviate from the rules of linear perspective
or any image projected by a camera, 
and to combine or improvise whatever skills and techniques 
(both intellectual and instrumental) at their disposal, 
with the singular goal of fulfilling the needs of their artwork 
(or perhaps, in a less than ideal world, the needs of their patrons).
