This course is titled
.
It must be clarified from the start that
due to time constraint and the academic limitations of the instructor,
we are concerned only with  visual art, which is itself an ambiguous label.

By any reasonable standard, it is simply impossible to give broad but accurate definitions of words like "Western" and "visual art".
We will stay close to the conventional narrative of Western art history,
namely the one which is typically adopted by a first-year undergraduate Western art history curriculum.
That said, this course has no capacity nor intention of giving a thorough account of Western art.
To help familiarize ourselves with the artistic context of this course,
we give in the following pages a skeletal body of specific examples of artwork, along with brief comments on their historical contexts.

Roughly, the timeline/geography which we cover stretches (in leaps and bounds) from the Greek Classical Era to Western Europe in the beginning of the twentieth century.
It is admittedly a  brief and incomplete summary.
We strongly encourage students to explore the art historical aspects of this course in more depth for personal enrichment.  We assure you that as an endeavour of self-cultivation it is well worth the time and effort.

WEAVING: When we speak of Western art history,
the word "Western" suggests to us certain countries in Western Europe with which we are familiar today: Germany, Austria, Britain, France, Spain, Italy....
Then, the oldest extant examples of Western art might said to be prehistoric figurines such as the Venus of Willendorf and the Lascaux cave paintings, made in the Late Stone Age.

However, in most conventional narratives such prehistoric artworks do not play significant roles in the subsequent development of Western art.

Within the context of this course, it suffices to say that towards the end of the 14th century, a confluence of economic, cultural, political and even environmental factors resulted in an explosion of cultural and intellectual activities in several urban centers (Florence, Venice, Naples,...) in the Italian peninsula.  The Italian Renaissance then spread northward to regions which later became present day France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany.  It was during the Renaissance that linear perspective took a prominent role in painting.

The Renaissance also saw a revival in the development of mathematics.
The mathematical theory of linear perspective in painting were developed by a number of individuals, such as Filippo Brunelleschi (who designed the famous Duomo in Florence)
and Leon Battista Alberti.

It was also during the 17th Century that Europe saw a great number of scientific/mathematical advances, due to the work of individuals such as Galileo, Newton, Leibniz and Descartes.  Descartes introduced what we now call the Cartesian coordinate system, which provides a means to link geometry and algebra (a revolutionary idea at the time), while Calculus (differentiation, integration) was developed by Newton and Leibniz independently.
Newton was also the first to demonstrate the spectrum of colours in natural light,
which is a milestone for subsequent developments in colour theory.

From this period on, mathematics was to take on an ever more prominent role in the scientific investigations of the natural world.  This trend would continue to the present day.

Artists (Claude Monet, Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Camille Pissarro, Alfred Sisley) who are often labeled as impressionists tended to favour outdoor  painting (made possible by the introduction of oil paints packaged in metal tubes), with great emphasis placed on capturing the effect of light, using novel ideas in colour theory,
new styles of paint application,
and oil paints which had been unavailable before the Industrial Revolution.

One key figure in Post-Impressionism is a certain Frenchman named Paul Cézanne (1839-1906),
and with him it might very well be argued that the age of Modern Art began.
From then on the world saw the works of Matisse, Picasso, Delaunay, Chirico, Morandi, Marc, Ernst, Beckmann, Kandinsky, Klee....  There was also a distinct shift of momentum to the USA, led by such painters as Gorky, Rothko, DeKooning, Pollock, Motherwell, Newman (many of whom were immigrants from Europe).
By this point, it is evident from just the long lists of names that the art world would grow at an ever greater rate, and in ever more diverse directions.
So, we will stop here, lest these notes never end.
